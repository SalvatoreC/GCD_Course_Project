FILE NAME : trainAndTestDS.txt
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A tidy data set containing test (2947) and training (7352) observations for a total of 10299 observations (rows) of 8 variables. As requested, only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement were extracted.

Column names:
  "activityName" (activity_labels.txt: the descriptive activity name): factor w/6 levels
  "subjectID" (subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt: the volunteer's ID): int w/30 unique values
  "tBodyAccMeanX" (features.txt: "tBodyAcc-mean()-X"): num
  "tBodyAccMeanY" (features.txt: "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y"): num
  "tBodyAccmeanZ" (features.txt: "tBodyAcc-mean()-Z"): num
  "tBodyAccStdX" (features.txt: "tBodyAcc-std()-X"): num
  "tBodyAccStdY" (features.txt: "tBodyAcc-std()-Y"): num
  "tBodyAccStdZ" (features.txt: "tBodyAcc-std()-Z"): num
  

FILE NAME : averageActAndSubj.txt
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A second, independent tidy data set created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
This data set has been calculated from the previus data set (trainAndTestDS.txt), averaging mean and standard variation measures over 6 activities x 30 subjects = 180 observations (rows) of 8 variables.

Column names:
  "activityName" (see trainAndTestDS.txt)
  "subjectID" (see trainAndTestDS.txt)
  "tBodyAccMeanX": num, calculated average foe each activity and each subject
  "tBodyAccMeanY": num, calculated average foe each activity and each subject
  "tBodyAccmeanZ": num, calculated average foe each activity and each subject
  "tBodyAccStdX": num, calculated average foe each activity and each subject
  "tBodyAccStdY": num, calculated average foe each activity and each subject
  "tBodyAccStdZ": num, calculated average foe each activity and each subject
